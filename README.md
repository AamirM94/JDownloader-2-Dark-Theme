# Jdownloader 2 Dark Theme
After seeing so many requests for a dark theme, I configured my own. 
It uses the "Black Eye" UserInterfaceSetting and a matching colorscheme I configured for the rest of the window. 
I have not found anywhere it looks strange or where you cant read the text. 
I hope someone finds good use for it :)
