These are whole backupfiles. Take huge care when using these, for these will OVERWRITE your settings with the settings in the files.
The settings in the backups are the JD2 defaults, with a configured dark theme and (only in customtoolbars) organized toolbars.

* JDownloaderDarkOnly - Contains Only the dark theme. No other custom settings included
* JDownloaderDarkCustomToolbars - Same as DarkOnly, only adding a some more organized toolbars (I think they are atleast, but customize away to your prefs!)
* JDownloaderDefault - What it says, all default values, as if a new install
